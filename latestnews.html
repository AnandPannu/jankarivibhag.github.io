        <h3>Schools Reopening Soon? - Latest Update</h3>
    
       
            <l>Published on : 26-o6-2021</l>
            <p>New Delhi: School reopening news: Schools across the country, most of which reopened in February-March after being closed for almost a year, had to be shut down again soon after, amid fears of the second wave of COVID-19 in the country. Students are now learning in online classes for over a year. With a declining number of Covid cases in many states, the question of reopening schools has come up again.
When will schools reopen in India? The centre was asked recently.

“A lot of things need to be considered while deciding on reopening schools; it's a different topic entirely. This is a question that keeps coming up in the government system,” said Dr VK Paul, Niti Aayog (health) member.

Many countries had to shut down schools, soon after reopening, as cases grew. “We don't want to put our children, teachers in that situation unless we have more confidence that the pandemic won't harm us,” Dr Paul said.

Though it seems the centre has no plan to reopen schools soon, some states have taken steps in this direction.

        <h3>CBSE Class 12 Evaluation Criteria 2021</h3>
    <l>Published on : 26-o6-2021</l>

            <p>New Delhi: Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank' will address questions from students about the CBSE Class 10 and Class 12 examinations tomorrow, June 25, at 4 pm. The Central Board of Secondary Education cancelled its Class 12 board exams on June 1, a decision taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Large numbers of students and parents had been seeking cancellation due to the surge in Covid cases since April. Since then, the CBSE has submitted in the Supreme Court of India and then notified the alternative CBSE Class 12 assessment criteria. The CBSE 12th result 2021 will be based on the CBSE Class 10 results for the batch, their performance in Class 11 and in Class 12.</p>

        <h3>Govt, civic bodies join hands to ensure smooth transition of students</h3>
    <l>Published on : 26-o6-2021</l>
    
            <p>The Delhi government’s Directorate of Education (DoE) and the Municipal Corporations of Delhi (MCDs) on Tuesday joined hands to track each student who transitioned from corporation schools to government ones in Class 6 this year.

The move comes after government schools faced several challenges in tracking such students last year as their admissions were done virtually due to the closure of schools in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Every year, around 170,000 students move from municipal schools that offer education only up to Class 5 to government schools in Class 6.</p>

        <h3>CBSE launches online system for students to get duplicate academic document</h3>
    <l>Published on : 25-o6-2021</l>
        
            <p>The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) today launched the duplicate academic document system (DADS) to help students with duplicate copies of their academic documents either because they have lost or are mutilated.

As of now, these students approach concerned regional offices or apply on a prescribed form and deposit required fees in the banks or alternately send forms and bank drafts by post. But, the Covid-19 situation has made it difficult to follow this process.</p>
